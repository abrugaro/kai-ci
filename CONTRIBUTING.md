Welcome! We are glad that you want to contribute to our project! üíñ

As you get started, you are in the best position to give us feedback on areas of
the project that we need help with, including:

- Problems found during setting up a new test development environment
- Gaps in our Quickstart Guide or documentation
- Bugs in our automation scripts

If anything doesn't make sense, or doesn't work when you run it, please open a
bug report and let us know!

## Ways to Contribute

We welcome many different types of contributions including:

- New features
- Builds, CI/CD
- Bug fixes
- Documentation
- Answering questions on Slack/Mailing List
- Communications / Social Media / Blog Posts

Not everything happens through a GitHub pull request. Please come to our
[meetings](#come-to-meetings) or [contact us](#contact-us) and let's discuss how
we can work together.

### Come to Meetings

Please consider joining the [Konveyor community
meetings](https://github.com/konveyor/community?tab=readme-ov-file#konveyor-community-meetings).

Everyone is welcome to come to any of our meetings. You never need an invite to
join us. In fact, we want you to join us, even if you don‚Äôt have anything you
feel like you want to contribute. Just being there is enough!

You can find out more about our meetings
[here](https://github.com/konveyor/community?tab=readme-ov-file#konveyor-community-meetings).
You don‚Äôt have to turn on your video. The first time you come, introducing
yourself is more than enough. Over time, we hope that you feel comfortable
voicing your opinions, giving feedback on others‚Äô ideas, and even sharing your
own ideas and experiences.

## Find an Issue

We have good first issues for new contributors and help wanted issues suitable
for any contributor.

- The [good first
  issue](https://github.com/konveyor/kai/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
  tag has extra information to help you make your first contribution.
- The [help wanted](https://github.com/konveyor/kai/labels/help%20wanted) tag
  has issues that are suitable for someone who isn't a core maintainer and is
  good to pursue after your first pull request.

Sometimes there won‚Äôt be any issues with these labels. That‚Äôs ok! There is
likely still something for you to work on. If you want to contribute but don‚Äôt
know where to start or can't find a suitable issue, you can reach out to us in
[slack](#slack)

Once you see an issue that you'd like to work on, please post a comment saying
that you want to work on it. Something like "I want to work on this" is fine.

## Ask for Help

The best way to reach us with a question when contributing is to ask on:

- The original GitHub issue
- [The developer mailing list](https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/konveyor-dev)
- [Our Slack channel - #konveyor-dev](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C04QZJFQ0UA)

## Pull Request Lifecycle

- Please submit pull requests for the `main` branch
- Please link your PR to an existing issue, if an existing issue is not present
  consider creating a new issue
- If the PR is not yet ready you may mark it as a draft, and then once it's
  ready for review remove the draft status and add a comment to let us know you
  are ready for a review.

## Pull Request Title

Please ensure the title of your PR begins with a
[gitmoji](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji). A few examples (with our
custom changes) are:

|    |              |                                |
|----|--------------|--------------------------------|
| üêõ | `:bug:`      | Bug fixes                      |
| üìñ | `:book:`     | Documentation                  |
| ‚ú®  | `:sparkles:` | New features                   |
| üå± | `:seedling:` | Infrastructure related changes |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è | `:warning:`  | Breaking changes               |
| üëª | `:ghost:`    | Misc updates/fixes             |

For a full list, please check out [gitmoji.dev](https://gitmoji.dev)

Additionally, please make sure your PR title is in the _past tense_. This is
because we generate our release notes from PR titles.

## Environment

- Please include a unit test for new features
- See [e2e-environment.md](docs/contrib/e2e-environment.md) for more guidance on
  testing

## Sign Your Commits

### DCO

Licensing is important to open source projects. It provides some assurances that
the software will continue to be available based on the terms that the author(s)
desired. We require that contributors sign off on commits submitted to our
project's repositories. The [Developer Certificate of Origin
(DCO)](https://probot.github.io/apps/dco/) is a way to certify that you wrote
and have the right to contribute the code you are submitting to the project.

You sign off by adding the following to your commit messages. Your sign-off must
match the git user and email associated with the commit.

```bash
    This is my commit message
    Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.name@example.com>
```

Git has a `-s` command line option to do this automatically:

```bash
    git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'
```

If you forgot to do this and have not yet pushed your changes to the remote
repository, you can amend your commit with the sign-off by running

```bash
    git commit --amend -s
```
